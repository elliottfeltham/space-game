# space-game

An asteroids inspired game using no images and only draw functions from Pygame. This project is used to practice OOP in Python and Pygame. I tried using classes to make it easy to edit and refactor the code in the future. I broke smaller task into helper functions which helped improve readability in my main file. The physics of the game required more math than I expected but helped me understand vectors and trigonomtery in a real world application.
